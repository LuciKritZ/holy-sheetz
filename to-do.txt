1. Modify cell properties
2. Storing the cell properties
3. Two way binding:
  1. Changing the stored cell properties whenever a user changes a cell properties.
  2. Show the same changes in UI.
4. Implement dynamic formula bar actions in the UI
  1. Formula Evaluation - Enter event
    a. Normal expression: Basic arithmetic
    b. Dependency expression: Dependent on other cells (eg A1 + A2 + 10)
  2. In between Data update: Recursively using tree/graph - Parent child relationship
  3. Push/Pop children dynamically based on the formula.
  4. Changing already set value/hardcoding value instead of formula - Remove formula - Remove parent relations - Update child relations
